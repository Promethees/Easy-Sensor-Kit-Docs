		+ For the next time you'd like to run the application and be sure every dependencies have been correctly installed by `start-1` and `start-2`, you can run `start-3` right away.

## Overview
This document provides instruction on deploying a web interface that helps visualize data recorded by a handy colorimeter, inspired by [IORodeo Open Colorimeter](https://iorodeo.com/products/open-colorimeter) 

## Features
* ***Init prompt*** Instruct you to select the correct started Directory for Directory Picker

<div align="center">
	<img src="/images/init-prompt.png" width="600">
</div>

* ***Directory*** Browse host's directories to select CSV files.

<div align="center">
	<img src="/images/browse.png" width="600">
</div>

* ***Set measurement Modes*** The Applicatiob has 3 modes: `kinetics`, `point`, `calibrate`

* ***Select type of Calibration*** You can specify which calibration you're calculating for, either `kinetics` or `point`

* ***Log HID*** Get data being sent from the ***PyBadge*** colorimeter. Specifiying location and file pattern name in `--base-dir` and `--base-name`. The logged file is saved at: `\log\script_logs.txt`. Disabled in **calibrate** mode
	- ***Note***: Due to security reason, the API we used for ***Select Directory*** only allows you correctly browse and select immediate Child/Parent directories at a time. You might modify to get the correct path in the interactive text box.

<div align="center">
	<img src="/images/logHID.png" width="600">
</div>

* ***Standard lines*** Choose standard line you'd like to derive concentration from measurements. Disabled in `calibrate` mode. You can read detailed description in each standard line json to understand the calculation methods.

<div align="center">
	<img src="/images/standardJSON.png" width="600">
</div>

* ***File Selection*** When a directory with csv files is browsed, the list of selectable csv files are displayed under ***File Selection*** table. Currently, the feature only supports display data from ***ONE*** file at a time. Click `Select` to visualize the chosen csv, `Deselect` to turn the visualization off.

<div align="center">
	<img src="/images/fileselection.png" width="600">
</div>

* ***CSV File Edit*** You may click on ***Edit*** button to modify the content of the respective CSV file. It comes in 2 modes:
	- `Table`:

	<div align="center">
		<img src="/images/csvtableedit.png" width="600">
	</div>

	- `Raw Text`:

	<div align="center">
		<img src="/images/csvtextedit.png" width="600">
	</div>

* ***Data Display***:
	- `Display Range` Modification in display range changes the displayed data and respective unit displayed on the plot. 
	- `Split by Blanked` Seperate data points into 2 plots, ***Blanked*** and ***Non-Blanked***, which is set by value of column ['Blanked'] in the browsed csv.

	<div align="center">
		<img src="/images/blank.png" width="600">
	</div>

	- `Full Display` Enable, Disable graphics of `Vmax` (maximum reaction velocity throughout the process), `Linear` (average speed along reaction stage), `Sat` (Measured value at saturating point when no longer reactions happening) lines. When it is checked and a csv file is being browsed, all data of that file will be shown and `Display Range` value should be disabled.
	- In `kinetics` and `point` measurement modes, displayed data should show Measurement values (i.e Absorbance agains Time) 

	<div align="center">
		<img src="/images/meas.png" width="600">
	</div>

	- In `calibrate` mode, if selected calibration type is `kinetics`, you can select which of these quantity: `Vmax`, `Slope` of `Linear` progression, `Sat`, and `Time to Saturation`.

	<div align="center">
		<img src="/images/calKinetics.png" width="600">
	</div>

	- In `calibrate` mode, if selected calibration type is `point`, you can select among timepoints, which are exported to the selected file earlier in the measuring stage for calibration. 

	<div align="center">
		<img src="/images/calPoint.png" width="600">
	</div>


* `Display Range` Filter data by time range and unit (seconds, minutes, hours). Only latest `<time><unit>` data points will be displayed. Disabled in `calibrate` mode

<div align="center">
	<img src="/images/displayrange.png" width="600">
</div>

* `Window size` Specifies the number of data in a group to determine local slopes. Minimum is 3, maximum is half of data size in the browsing csv file. Disabled in `point`, `calibrate` mode

<div align="center">
	<img src="/images/window.png" width="600">
</div>

* `Export Analysis` 
	- Become ***Export coefficients for standard line*** in `calibrate` mode
	- For both `kinetics` and `point` modes:
			+ Set `Display Unit` to `minutes` to ensure consistency among exported readings
			+ When setting export of analysis for Blank Type `MIXED`, display graphic must be in non Split mode. In the opposite way, whenever Blank Type is either `BLANKED` or `NON-BLANKED`, Split mode is needed (also applied in `calibrate` mode)
	- For `point` mode, key in the time point, the system will export with corresponding approximated measurement value at that time point for you. 
	<div align="center">
		<img src="/images/exportA.png" width="600">
	</div>

	- For `calibrate` mode, you can specify the corresponding regression algorithm to export standard line with coefficients and plot on the chart. The value in `Enter the threshold value for rSquared` let you decides the minimum value of rSquared allowed for meaningful regression (i.g, only regression whose rSquared is larger than this value is exported with coefficients, otherwise, the respective coefficients being exported will be denoted as `NONE` values)
	<div align="center">
		<img src="/images/exportC.png" width="600">
	</div>

	- ***Note***: Due to security reason, the API we used for ***Select Directory*** only allows you correctly browse and select immediate Child/Parent directories at a time. You might modify to get the correct path in the interactive text box.
	
## Notes

* The app assumes Timestamp in CSV files is in seconds. Adjust baseMultiplier in index.html if your data uses a different unit.
